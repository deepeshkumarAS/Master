Cricket is a widely celebrated sport that has the charm to captivate fans on a global scale with its blend of strategy, athleticism, and suspense. We explore the implementation of automated notifications to enrich the spectator experience during cricket matches. These notifications serve to keep fans informed about key events such as wickets, boundaries, milestones, and match results, ensuring they stay engaged and up to date throughout the game. This guide elaborates how automated systems enhance viewer engagement and provide timely updates, thereby enhancing the overall spectator experience of cricket matches.
Automated Milestone Notifications: We used the One signal API key to deliver alerts straight to an app developed so that viewers would be aware of player achievements during the cricket match. By providing real-time updates on significant events like 50s, 100s and noteworthy accomplishments, this improves viewer engagement and enriches the viewing experience.
 Estimating Win/Loss probabilities: The prediction of the results of a cricket match required multidimensional strategy. To confirm the likelihood of a team winning or losing, we used a Random Forest Classifier model that used a variety of match factors, team compositions, and past performance data.
Prediction of Score potential: We used pitch conditions, player form, and past data, along with the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to forecast a batting team's probable score. Through extensive parameter tuning and the use of a Stacking Regressor.
4) Usage of data: We used the One signal API to quickly alert spectators about upcoming milestones that we predicted based on player statistics. Throughout the cricket match, our data-driven strategy guarantees prompt and accurate information on noteworthy player accomplishments.
